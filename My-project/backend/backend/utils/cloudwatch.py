"""
backend/utils/cloudwatch.py

CloudWatch custom metric publisher for worker liveness monitoring.

Publishes one metric per worker to the CyberRange/Workers namespace:
    WorkerHeartbeatAge  — seconds since last heartbeat (Seconds unit)

A CloudWatch alarm triggers when this value exceeds the threshold defined
in the monitoring Terraform module (default: 60 seconds).

Usage
-----
Called by the background task in main.py every METRIC_PUBLISH_INTERVAL_S seconds.

The publisher runs as a lightweight asyncio task — it does not block the
API event loop because boto3 calls are offloaded to a thread pool executor.

Configuration
-------------
No new env vars needed — uses AWS_REGION from existing settings.
AWS credentials come from the EC2 instance profile (same as Terraform).

Add to requirements.txt:
    boto3==1.40.48  (already present)
